Singapore Botanic Gardens:
Location: 1 Cluny Road, Singapore, 259569.
Date: 17 June 2024
The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the oldest tropical gardens in the world. But it is too large to be visited in one day. The weather is too hot and too humid. Too tiring to walk around in this super large garden.
